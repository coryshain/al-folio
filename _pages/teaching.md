# LING 2000
_Introduction to Linguistics_

The Ohio State University. Autumn 2017, Spring 2018.

I taught two semesters of Ohio State's undergraduate introduction to linguistics.

### Course description

The human capacity for language is one of our most astonishing traits. It allows us
to express ideas of (in principle) infinite variety and complexity, it has no known
parallel elsewhere in the animal kingdom, it exhibits extraordinary diversity across
human communities, and yet nearly all human infants acquire it within the first few
years of life. The study of natural language has contributed to the fields of psychology,
anthropology, history, computer science, formal language theory, information theory,
philosophy, and sociology. Linguistics has major applications in natural language
processing (e.g. Siri, machine translation, medical information retrieval, etc.),
speech/language pathology and audiology, law, advertising, cryptography and cybersecurity,
and education and public policy. Globalization has intensified the need for language
skills as a prerequisite to success in many career fields. At the same time, a rapidly
growing proportion of the worldâ€™s languages are in danger of dying out, making it
increasingly urgent to document the linguistic diversity of our species. In other words,
there has never been a better time to study linguistics!

LING 2000 (Introduction to Linguistics) is an introductory course in linguistics for
both linguistics majors and non-majors with an interest in language. In this course,
we will explore the structure of human languages, acquire tools to analyze their properties,
and become familiar with some of the questions driving modern linguistic research.
