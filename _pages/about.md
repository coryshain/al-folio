I'm a post-doctoral researcher at MIT, supervised by [Ev Fedorenko](https://evlab.mit.edu/).
I did my PhD in computational linguistics at Ohio State, where I was advised by
[William Schuler](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/schuler.77/) and
[Micha Elsner](https://u.osu.edu/elsner.14/).

I use computational and experimental methods to study language and the mind, particularly
(1) the cognitive processes that allow us to understand the things we hear and read so
quickly, (2) the learning signals that we leverage as children to acquire language from
the environment, and (3) the role played by real-time information processing constraints
in shaping language learning and comprehension. I've also done some linguistic fieldwork
in the Iyasa language of Cameroon.
