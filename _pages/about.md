I'm an Assistant Professor of Linguistics at Stanford University. Before that, I was 
a post-doctoral researcher at MIT, supervised by [Ev Fedorenko](https://evlab.mit.edu/).
I did my PhD in computational linguistics at Ohio State, where I was advised by
[William Schuler](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/schuler.77/) and
[Micha Elsner](https://u.osu.edu/elsner.14/).

I use computational and experimental methods to study language and the mind, particularly
(1) the cognitive processes that allow us to understand the things we hear and read so
quickly, (2) the learning signals that we leverage as children to acquire language from
the environment, and (3) the role played by real-time information processing constraints
in shaping language learning and comprehension.

I often build [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) models to
investigate these questions, and I'm actively developing
[machine learning techniques](https://coryshain.github.io/projects/cdr_project/) to help
scientists understand complex dynamical systems like the human mind and brain. My work
intersects machine learning, cognitive science, neuroscience, artificial intelligence,
natural language processing, statistics, and (psycho)linguistics.

I've also done some linguistic analysis of Guaran√≠ (spoken in Paraguay) and Iyasa
(spoken in Cameroon).
