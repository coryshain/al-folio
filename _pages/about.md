I'm an Assistant Professor of Linguistics at Stanford University.
I use computational and experimental methods to study language in the mind and brain,
particularly (1) the cognitive processes that allow us to understand the things we hear
and read so quickly, (2) the role played by real-time information processing constraints
in shaping language learning and comprehension, and (3) the brain basis both of these
abilities and of closely-related domain-general abilities related to perception, memory,
problem-solving, and social reasoning. My work  intersects machine learning, cognitive 
(neuro)science, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and
(psycho)linguistics.

Previously, I was a post-doctoral researcher at MIT, supervised by
[Ev Fedorenko](https://evlab.mit.edu/). I did my PhD in computational linguistics at 
Ohio State, where I was advised by
[William Schuler](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/schuler.77/) and
[Micha Elsner](https://u.osu.edu/elsner.14/).
