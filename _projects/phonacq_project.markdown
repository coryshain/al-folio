Acquiring our first language from environmental evidence is one of the most difficult
learning problems we ever face, and we face it in early childhood, when we are most
cognitively limited. The learning signals that children use to extract linguistic
regularities from speech have been the subject of intensive theorizing, but they
are challenging to study experimentally.

One of my core lines of research complements experimental work in this domain by
*simulating* the process of learning from speech using unsupervised deep neural
networks. These computational simulations allow both (1) fine-grained interventions
on the network architecture and learning objectives and (2) detailed inspection
of acquired representations, enabling us to test causal links between the structure
of the learner and the result of the learning process.
